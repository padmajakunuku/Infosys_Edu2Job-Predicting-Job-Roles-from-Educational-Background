# 💼 Job Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📘 Overview
The **Job Prediction System** is a machine learning-based application designed to predict the most suitable job role for a candidate based on their skills, education, and experience.  
This project aims to assist job seekers and recruiters by providing data-driven career insights and improving the matching process between candidates and potential job profiles.

Our model leverages various ML algorithms — including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and K-Means clustering — to analyze candidate profiles and classify them into optimal job categories.  

A user-friendly **Streamlit web application** is developed to provide an interactive interface for users to input their details and get predictions in real time.
